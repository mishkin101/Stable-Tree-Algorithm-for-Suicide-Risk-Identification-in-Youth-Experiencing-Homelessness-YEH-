  abstract = {Previous research has shown that homeless youth have high rates of suicidal ideation, sexual abuse, and abuse of alcohol and other drugs. However, little is known about how these rates differ by gender and ethnicity. Our objective was to describe patterns of sexual abuse, alcohol and other drug use, and indicators of suicidal behaviors in homeless adolescents and to determine gender and ethnic differences in these factors. We used secondary data analysis of data from surveys completed by 96 homeless youth whose average age was 17.9 years. Over 60\% of the sample reported a history of sexual abuse; the majority were under the age of 12 years when they first tried alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine; 56.3\% had injected drugs, and 46.9\% had tried inhalants. During the past 12 months, 35.1\% had seriously considered suicide and 12.3\% had actually attempted suicide at least once. Significantly more Hispanics than Whites had considered suicide (chi 2 = 4.31, p = .038). A disproportionate number of Hispanics (95\% of the sample) reported a history of sexual abuse. Participants with a history of sexual abuse were significantly more likely than those who did not have a history of sexual abuse to have used alcohol and/or marijuana (chi 2 = 9.93, p {$<$} .01) and to have considered suicide in the past 12 months (F = 14.93, p {$<$} .001). We found that sexual abuse history is greater in this sample than in the general population and is particularly prevalent among Hispanic/Latino subjects. As in other studies, sexual abuse was more common among females than among males. High prevalence of sexual abuse, alcohol and other drug use, and suicidal behaviors in this sample of homeless youth underscores the need to develop and test community-based interventions to improve their health status.},

  abstract = {Background: Although the protective value of social connectedness is emphasized in suicide prevention programming, little is known about the relationship between connectedness in high-risk runaway and homeless youth (RHY) networks and suicidal ideation. Aims: The study examined how social connectedness, in the form of social network position and network exposures, was associated with suicidal ideation among RHY. Method: Using population-level social network data from 384 RHY, each youth’s network position and exposure to potentially suicidogenic peer attributes were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between network position (core vs. periphery), peer exposures (e.g., depressed or suicidal peers), and suicidal ideation. Results: In univariable analyses, being in the core of the network and being connected to greater proportions of depressed and suicidal peers increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation. In the final multivariable model, higher exposure to depressed peers remained associated with suicidal ideation, and a marginal effect for network position was observed. Conclusion: The risk of suicidal ideation was linked to depression among peers and to a lesser extent being more integrated into the RHY network. Identifying and treating depression in naturally occurring friendship groups, particularly in the core of the network, represents a promising network-level intervention.

  abstract = {In many low‐ and middle‐income countries, including Zambia, stockouts of life‐saving medicines threaten the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); it is therefore vital to reduce stockouts through the use of improved inventory control policies. The associated medicine distribution problem is challenging because it involves seasonality and uncertainty in both demand and lead times, heterogeneous delivery locations, and lost demand. Besides service level and inventory costs, equity across delivery locations must also be considered. This empirical study is based on an independently validated simulation model constructed from extensive field data, and addresses the lack of rigorous recommendations of inventory policies in this context. It compares the current base‐stock and other policies proposed in the practitioner's literature with an optimization‐based policy adapted from research on industrial settings. Although the optimization‐based policy may need more implementation efforts, it generally outperforms the other evaluated policies. Our results also suggest that the prevalent proportional inventory rationing rules may lead to substantial service level discrepancies between facilities. Finally, the performance metrics of service level and distribution equity can be at odds, prompting non‐trivial design trade‐offs and considerations. This work motivated the development of a digital distribution information system involving smartphones with barcode scanners deployed in 60 health centers, posts, and district hospitals in Zambia until 2018.},

In the original article, the percentage in Table 1 for 'suicidal ideation in last 12 months' should be 27\%. In Table 3, the number of homeless youth without a concurrent disorder reporting a previous arrest should be 51.] Among marginalized populations, homeless adults are known to have elevated rates of mental health and substance use problems compared to the general population, but less is known about their youthful homeless counterparts. While few studies currently exist, what research has been conducted among street-involved youth has confirmed high rates of comorbidity among this population. However, few of these studies explore predictors of concurrent mental health and substance use problems among street-involved youth and consider broader health and social implications. The aim of the current study was to expand on current knowledge of comorbidity among street-involved youth by examining prevalence and correlates of self-reported concurrent mental health and substance use problems among a sample of 150 street-involved youth in Toronto, Canada. Results of descriptive and bivariate analyses revealed that a quarter of the participants experienced concurrent mental health and substance use problems, and that more youth with concurrent problems had experienced physical child maltreatment, greater transience, street victimization and previous arrest compared to youth without concurrent problems. Logistic regression results showed that street-involved youth with concurrent problems were almost four times more likely to have been victimized in the last 12 months. These results highlight a more disadvantaged health and social profile among street-involved youth with concurrent mental health and substance use problems, and underscore the need for increased research attention on treatment accessibility and needs among this population.

The literature on homeless youth, although developing, is still somewhat limited as it relates to mental health, substance abuse, and trauma. This study was motivated by clinically observed high rates of mental illness, trauma, dangerousness issues, and drug and alcohol abuse. Using archival data from mental health evaluations conducted over two years, variables including gender, age, ethnicity, primary diagnosis, drug of choice, trauma history, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and legal history were assessed. Results discovered significantly higher than expected diagnoses of mental illness and associations between drug of choice and diagnosis, trauma history and suicidal ideation, and trauma history and diagnosis. Results suggest a strong need for co-occurring treatment, trauma-focused therapy, and attention to both mental illness and substance abuse in homeless youth.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between home life risk factors and suicide attempts among homeless and runaway street youth recruited from both shelters and street locations in Denver, CO; New York City; and San Francisco, CA. METHOD: Street youth 12-19 years old (N = 775) were recruited by street outreach staff in Denver, New York City and San Francisco in 1992 and 1993 and interviewed. Cross-sectional, retrospective data were analyzed to examine the relationship between suicide attempts and antecedent home life variables. Logistic regression was used to identify factors predicting suicide attempts. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of the females and 27\% of the males had attempted suicide. The mean number of suicide attempts was 6.2 (SD = 12.9) for females and 5.1 for males (SD = 7.6). Among females, 70\% reported sexual abuse and 35\% reported physical abuse. Among males, 24\% reported sexual abuse and 35\% reported physical abuse. Sexual and physical abuse before leaving home were independent predictors of suicide attempts for females and males. Other home life factors hypothesized to be risk factors for suicide attempts were not significant. Interaction terms were not significant. Among street youth who were sexually or physically abused in this sample, the odds of attempting suicide were 1.9 to 4.3 times the odds of attempting suicide among those not sexually or physically abused. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions attempting to reduce risky behaviors in this population must include assessments of suicidal behaviors as well as components for assisting youth in dealing with the behavioral and emotional sequelae of physical and sexual abuse.},

Data were obtained from 100 homeless youth accessing an emergency shelter. The comparison group was comprised of 70 youth accessing local community drop-in centers that lived with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and had never stayed in a shelter. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression statistics. Relative to non-homeless youth, homeless youth were more likely to report drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, legal problems, academic difficulties, and mental health problems. Homeless youth presented with a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, depressive symptomatology, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Disengagement coping was a predictor of suicidal ideation, past attempts, depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youth. Conclusions: Relative to non-homeless youth, findings indicate that homeless youth reported greater use of a disengaging coping style and are at greater risk for high-risk behaviors, past suicide attempts, and clinically elevated levels of depressive symptoms and behavior problems.

  abstract = {Owing to their inherently interpretable structure, decision trees are commonly used in applications where interpretability is essential. Recent work has focused on improving various aspects of decision trees, including their predictive power and robustness; however, their instability, albeit well-documented, has been addressed to a lesser extent. In this paper, we take a step towards the stabilization of decision tree models through the lens of real-world health care applications due to the relevance of stability and interpretability in this space. We introduce a new distance metric for decision trees and use it to determine a tree's level of stability. We propose a novel methodology to train stable decision trees and investigate the existence of trade-offs that are inherent to decision tree models - including between stability, predictive power, and interpretability. We demonstrate the value of the proposed methodology through an extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of six case studies from real-world health care applications, and we show that, on average, with a small 4.6\% decrease in predictive power, we gain a significant 38\% improvement in the model's stability.},
