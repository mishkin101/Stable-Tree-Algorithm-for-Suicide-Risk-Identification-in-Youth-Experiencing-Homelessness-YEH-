## Problem Context and Background
- **Aim:** Predict suicidal experiences among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH)

## Dataset Considerations
- Missing data
- Imputed data (MICE)
- Imbalanced classes

## Previous decision tree models



## Stable Decision Trees

## Proposed Plan - 1. Understand the instability of provided DT
1. Understand the instability of provided DT
    - Given model exists as 2 python files (for `suicidea` and `suicattemp`)
    - Create simple example to deterministically try various splits
    - Empirically measure the difference in predicted splits

## Proposed Plan - 2. Stable DT

2. Implement a stable DT (Bertsimas et al. 2023)
    1. Train initial set **(T0)** of decision trees on a subset of the data
    2. Train second set **(T)** of decision trees on the full dataset
    3. Compute **average distance** of each tree in **T** to **T0**
    4. Compute performance metrics of 


## Proposed Plan - 2. Measuing effectiveness of proposed model
- Optimization algorithms
- Measuring stability
    - 

## Project Goals and Outcomes
- Implement a stable decision tree model that is robust to train-test splits for better interpretability
