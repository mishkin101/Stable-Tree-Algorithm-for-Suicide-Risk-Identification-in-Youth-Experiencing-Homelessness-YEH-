## Problem Context and Background
- **Aim:** Predict suicidal experiences among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH)
- The provided decision tree model is unstable to change in train-test splits
- Can we find a robust model invariant to shifts in distributions that will procude the same best features indicative of suicide ideaiton and attempts?

## Dataset Considerations
- Missing data
    - 584, 587 samples remaining for each prediction model from initial listwise deletion method form oriignal 940 total samples
    - 4% of data set mising for suicideideation and attempy (36 and 40 samples respectively)
- Imbalanced classes
    - 83% labeled 2, 16% labeled 1 for suicideidea class
    - 88% labeled 0, 11% labeled 1 for suicideattempt class 


## Stable Decision Trees
- Bertsimas et al. (2023) proposes a method to create stable decision trees
- 1 of 6 datasets used is publicly available - Breast Cancer dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- Used to test and compare our implementation
- With satisfactory results, we will apply our implementation to the suicide dataset

## Proposed Plan - [1. Understand the instability of provided DT]{.highlighted}
- Given model exists as 2 python files (for `suicidea` and `suicattemp`)
- Create simple example to deterministically try various splits
- Empirically measure the difference in predicted splits

## Proposed Plan - 2. Implement a stable DT (Bertsimas et al. 2023)
1. Train initial set **(T0)** of decision trees on a subset of the data
2. Train second set **(T)** of decision trees on the full dataset
3. Compute **average distance** of each tree in **T** to **T0**
4. Compute performance metrics (AUC) of trees on validation/test set
5. For the trees in **T** we select the Pareto optimal trees by optimizing for predictive performance and distance to **T0**

## Proposed Plan - 3. Measuring effectiveness of proposed model
- Compare the performance of stable trees to the provided DT using metrics we define in step 1

**Key optimization algorithms to implement:**

- Distance between two trees
$$
d\bigl(\mathcal{T}_{1}, \mathcal{T}_{2}\bigr) 
\;=\;\min_{\{x\}}\;
\sum_{p\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{T}_{1})}\sum_{q\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{T}_{2})} d(p,q)\, x_{p,q}
\;+\;\sum_{p\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{T}_{1})} w(p)\, x_{p}
$$ the *Suicide Ideation* class has  83%  labeled as “2” while 16% are labeled “1.”. *Suicide Attempt:* has  88% are labeled “0” while 11% are labeled “1.”

- Pareto optimal tree
$$\mathbb{T}^{\star}=\arg\!\mathrm{max}\,f\!\left(d_{b},\alpha_{b}\right)\!$$
