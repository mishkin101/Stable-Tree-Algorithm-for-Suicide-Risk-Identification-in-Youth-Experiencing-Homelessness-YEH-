## Problem Context and Background
- **Aim:** Predict suicidal experiences among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH)

## Dataset Considerations
- Missing data
- Imputed data (MICE)
- Imbalanced classes

## Previous decision tree model

## Stable Decision Trees

## Optimization algorithms

## Measuring stability

## Project Goals and Outcomes
- Implement a stable decision tree model that is robust to train-test splits for better interpretability
